// helps in importing other files into the present file

// move parts into a separate file, then create a header file

// a header file ends with .h instead of .c
// holds declarations

// examples >>>> #include <stdio.h>

// the #include is  a preprocessor directive ; if a brancket is used
// it means that it is part of the standard library.

// but users header files are wrapped with double quotes

// #include "myfile.h" >> looks for it in current folder

// A folder structure can also be used:
// #include "myfolder/myfile.h"
